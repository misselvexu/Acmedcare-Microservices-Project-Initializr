Acmedcare+ Maven Repository Configuration

> [Configuration Reference](http://115.29.47.72:8082/acmedback/Acmedcare-Maven-Nexus/blob/master/README.md)

### Building from Source

You donâ€™t need to build from source to use `Acmedcare+ Template Project` (binaries in [repo.acmedcare.com](http://47.97.26.165:8081/repository/maven-public/)), 
but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, 
`Acmedcare+ Template Project` can be easily built with the maven wrapper. You also need JDK 1.8.

*First* : git clone source from gitlab
 
```bash
$ git clone http://115.29.47.72:8082/acmedback/Acmedcare-Microservices-Project-Template.git
```

*Second* : build

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need [Maven v3.5.0 or above](https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html).
